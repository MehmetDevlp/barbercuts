I will update the `Testimonials.tsx` component to match your requirements for "Müşteri Yorumları" (Client Stories).

Here is the plan:

1. **Update Content & Language:**

   * Change the section title from "Client Stories" to **"Müşteri Yorumları"**.

   * Replace the placeholder reviews with realistic Turkish reviews based on the Barbercuts profile (e.g., *"Profesyonel bir sanatkâr..."*, *"Antalya'nın en iyisi"*, etc.).

   * Add metadata for each review: Star rating (5/5), Date (e.g., "2 ay önce"), and Review Count.

2. **Implement Carousel Features:**

   * **Layout:** Change from a static grid to a **horizontal slider** (carousel) showing reviews side-by-side.

   * **Navigation:** Add **Left (<) and Right (>) arrows** for manual navigation.

   * **Pagination:** Add **Dots (. . . . .)** at the bottom to indicate the current page/slide.

3. **Add Summary Section:**

   * Display the **Overall Rating (4.9)**, a **Star representation**, and the **Total Review Count (210 Yorum)** prominently, as seen in Google Maps summaries.

4. **Visual Styling:**
